1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A. True and False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
or, and, not
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
OR Table                  
i/p1	i/p2	o/p                   
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	1
AND Table 
i/p1	i/p2	o/p
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1
NOT Table 
i/p1	o/p
0	1
1	0
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
A. False
not (5 > 4)
A. False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
A. True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
A. False
(True and True) and (True == False)
A. False
(not False) or (not True)
A. True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
<,>,<=, >=, ==, !=
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
equal to is a comparison opeartor, which returns true or false, whereas assignment operator uses single+
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
A. 1- if spam == 10:
         print('eggs')
   2- if spam > 5:
         print('bacon')
   3- else:
         print('ham')
         print('spam')
         print('spam')
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
 spam=2
 if spam ==1:
    print("Hello")
 if spam ==2:
    print("Howdy")
 else:
    print("Greetings!")
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
A. Ctrl+C
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A. Break and continue are conditional statements to come out of the loop. Break keyword is used to come out and terminate the loop immediately and continue is used to filter some statements in the loop or to skip some part.
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A. range(10) output- 0 1 2 3  4 5 6 7 8 9
   range(0,10) same output
   range(0, 10, 1) same output  
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A. for i in range(1,11):
       print(i)
   
   i=1
   while(i<11):
      print(i)
      i=i+1
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
bacon() like this or by passing some values inside the parenthesis.
