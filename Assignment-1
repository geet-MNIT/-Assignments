1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*                         expression
'hello'                   value
-87.8                     expression
-                         expression
/                         expression
+	                        expression
6                         value

2. What is the difference between string and variable? 
A. String is a datatype denoted by single or double quotes whereas variable is used to store the string or some other value in memory. eg- fruit="mango" , fruit is a variable and mango is a string.
3. Describe three different data types.
A. List- Stores the ordered collection of values like array and represented by [] square brackets. List are mutable.
   Dictionary- It stores the key value pair and denoted by {} curly braces. It is also mutable
   Tuple- Tuple is just like list but denoted by () brackets are they are immutable, i.e. we cannot update or change them once created.
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
A. Expresssion is made up of operators are operand together to perform a function like addition, multiplication etc. They are used to evaluate a result. eg- 3+24-83/2 is an expression.
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
A. Statements are anything which tells us to do something like print( "geetanjali"), whereas expressions are also statements which are used to evaluate a computation.
6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
A. 23
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
A. 'spamspamspam' and 'spamspamspam'
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid? 
A. 100 is starting with number so cannot be a valid variable whereas eggs are alphabets so no issue.
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
A. int(), float(), str() will be used respectively.
10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
A. String and integer cannot be merged together. We can make 99 as '99' string and then it can be evaluated.
